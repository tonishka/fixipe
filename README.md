Scans and fixes recipes - the Orbital Project of team bananix 
## Project Scope
We hope to make regular recipes customisable based on a user’s specific needs/restrictions.

## Motivation
Finding the perfect recipe is not always easy, but for people with allergies and/or other dietary restrictions, it can be a nightmare. They often spend more time than necessary on Google or buying extra cookbooks, only to end up with a recipe distantly related to what they were originally looking for - or one whose ingredients are too hard to find. As a result, such people may abandon this process completely, thus having wasted their time for a fruitless outcome.

## Aim
The objective of this project is to make regular recipes customisable according to a user’s particular dietary needs and preferences. We hope to make this process simple, efficient, and quick - just a quick scan and the user is presented with a host of options. This product is not just a one-time solution - users can store all their recipes so that they never have to run around looking for it again.
## How the app works
- Firstly, users will have to create an account, and then take a quiz to create a food profile based on their dietary restrictions. 

- Upon login, they can take a picture of any recipe, and ingredients that they cannot eat will automatically be substituted for alternatives that are easily accessible in any local supermarket. This modified recipe will attempt to preserve the taste of the original food item as much as possible.

- Users can then save these modified recipes to their app for later use so that they do not have to scan the recipe again and can save time accordingly.
