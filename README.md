Scans and fixes recipes - the Orbital Project of team bananix 
## Project Scope
We hope to make regular recipes customisable based on a user’s specific needs/restrictions.

## Motivation
Finding the perfect recipe is not always easy, but for people with allergies and/or other dietary restrictions, it can be a nightmare. They often spend more time than necessary on Google or buying extra cookbooks, only to end up with a recipe distantly related to what they were originally looking for - or one whose ingredients are too hard to find. As a result, such people may abandon this process completely, thus having wasted their time for a fruitless outcome.

## Aim
The objective of this project is to make regular recipes customisable according to a user’s particular dietary needs and preferences. We hope to make this process simple, efficient, and quick - just a quick scan and the user is presented with a host of options. This product is not just a one-time solution - users can store all their recipes so that they never have to run around looking for it again.
